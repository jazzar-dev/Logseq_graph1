- What is the difference between Passive and active transport?: #card
	- Active transport uses energy in the for of ATP to move from a place of low concentration to a place of high concentration
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Passive transport doesn't use energy since it goes from a place high concentration to a place of low concentration
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- What type of transport does the process of gas exchange use?: #card
		- Passive diffusion
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number

- What cell transports oxygen in the blood?: #card
	- Red Blood Cells (RBCs)
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- What makes it capable of doing so?: #card
		- Hemoglobin
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- What is Hemoglobin? #card
			- Hemoglobin is a protein that contains iron binding sites for oxygen.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- It's only found in RBCs*
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- How many iron binding sites does a single RBC have? #card
				- 4 iron binding sites thus 1 RBC can hold 4 oxygen molecules at a time
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Describe the process of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange: #card
	- Oxygen and Carbon dioxide are carried by the blood to and from the alveoli
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Oxygen diffuses from alveoli into capillary
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- oxygen binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells (RBCs)
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Carbon dioxide diffuses from capillary to alveoli
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- What part of the brain regulates breathing?: #card
	- The brain stem. Pons to be exact.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- 3 examples of lung diseases: #card
	- Emphysema (destroys alveoli)
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Asthma (constricts airways (bronchi or bronchioles))
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Cystic fibrosis (produces sticky mucus)
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Why is smoking the leading cause of lung diseases?: #card
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- It has many reasons mainly it's because of a chemical found in the cigarettes called nicotine.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Nicotine mainly blocks alveoli.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
