  collapsed:: true
	- Blood pressure is the measure of force against blood vessels.
	- What are the 2 types of pressure in the heart?: #card
		- Systolic pressure is: #card
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- When left ventricle contracts
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Diastolic pressure is: #card
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- When left ventricle relaxes
