- What is the heart?: #card
	- The heart is a muscular pump that pumps blood through 2 pathways.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- What type of muscle is the heart? What is special about that muscle?: #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The heart is a cardiac muscle
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Cardiac muscles always work involuntarily
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- How many chambers does the heart have?: #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The heart consists of 4 chambers them being: (Ventricles are the lower part and atriums are the upper part, each part has a valve to prevent backflow of blood)
		- Left atrium
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Left ventricle
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Right atrium
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Right ventricle
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- What are the heartbeat contraction?: #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The heartbeat consists of 2 contractions:
		- SA node (Sinoatrial), aka pacemaker, stimulates atrial contraction
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- AV node (Atrioventricular), stimulates ventricles to contract
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- What is the path of blood circulation in the heart?: #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The heart has a specific path through the body:
		- Oxygen poor blood enters the right atrium, then right ventricle
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Right ventricle pumps out oxygen poor blood to lungs
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Oxygen rich blood from the lungs goes to the left atrium, then to the left ventricle
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Left ventricle pumps out oxygen rich blood to the body parts
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- What is the path of blood circulation through the body?: #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- Lungs
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Pulmonary veins
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Left atruim
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Left ventricle
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Aortic artery
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Body parts/tissues
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Vena Cava
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Right atruim
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Right ventricle
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Pulmonary artery
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Lungs
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Which side of the heart is Oxygen-rich , which is oxygen-poor blood? #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- The left side of the heart is oxygen rich, while the right side of the blood is oxygen poor.
