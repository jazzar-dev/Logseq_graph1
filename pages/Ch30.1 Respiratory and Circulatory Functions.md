			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Pharnyx:
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  collapsed:: true

		  collapsed:: true
			- Contains the vocal cords.

	- Q: What happens to the Diaphragm muscle and rib cage when breathing in and breathing out?: #card
	  collapsed:: true
		- When you breathe in they both relax, the Diaphragm muscle goes up and the rib cage contracts.
		- When you breathe out muscles contract, the Diaphragm muscle goes down, and the ribcage expands.
